My name is Derek Guidorizzi, a Computer Science major specializing in AI applications and a recent graduate from The Pennsylvania State University. I noticed through joinrelentless.com that your enterprise respects strategies meant for successful job seeking that are mainly borrowed from the sales and marketing playbook. I applaud this unique approach.\n\nParticularly, I'd like to highlight my recent internship experience with OfferPilot, where I grappled with unique software issues and executed solutions, notably employing OpenAI framework to construct a LinkedIn profile grading tool. Coupling this with my active leadership roles at Noodles & Company, my ability to navigate both technical and managerial paths is something I would bring to any potential role.\n\nI feel my technical savvy and leadership experiences align exceptionally well with the vision and values at joinrelentless.com. I would appreciate an opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences can creatively innovate and foster job seeking strategies in line with your company's mission. \n\nThank you for your time, and I hope to hear from you soon.\n\nSincerely,\nDerek Guidorizzi\n"
