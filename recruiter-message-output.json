    "recruiter_message": "Dear Ms. Jaja,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I recently came across your profile and as someone who is passionate about sales and marketing skills and their application in technology, I would be delighted to discuss my background further.\n\nIn my role as an AI Engineer Intern at OfferPilot, I was fortunate enough to utilize OpenAI to develop a LinkedIn Profile grading tool, something that bridges the gap between sales, marketing, and tech. Your emphasis on these areas attracted my attention and I found a strong alignment with your recruiting objectives at Relentless.\n\nFurthermore, apart from technical know-how, through various positions I've held at Noodles & Company, Sportrock Climbing Center, and Sitemetric, I've honed my leadership skills and developed a strong aptitude for team collaboration, problem-solving, and communication.\n\nI'm really interested to learn more about opportunities at Relentless where I might contribute to the team. I am open to discussing further at your earliest convenience.\n\nThank you for considering my application. \n\nSincerely, \nDerek Guidorizzi"
