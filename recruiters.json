I absolutely do not understand the meaning of the word quite, because if I have set my mind to do something you can count on it to get done one way or another. That does not mean that I have not seen my fair share of failures though, because without failure we cannot appreciate success.\n\nJust out of High School, I served in the U.S. Navy for 20 years (1993- 2013) where I had many different job titles in many different types of environments and places. Starting as the new man on the team I did whatever task was required to keep things running and worked my way up to senior leadership positions where I learned the true value of teamwork and collaboration and how to manage a successful team. Finally, as a Navy Recruiter, I was able to “Pay-It-Forward” the chance that was once given to me so many years ago that certainly changed my life. As a teenager I had big dreams but didn’t necessarily have a direction to go in. Then a Navy Recruiter helped me find a path to both of these things, so at the end of my career I felt it was my turn to help those in need.\n\nToday I am an Entrepreneur, Internet Marketer, and Professional Sales Consultant enjoying time with my family. I love creating engaging content that draws in a viewer and encourages them to interact with my brand(s), either starting a new relationship or continuing to fan the flames of an existing one. To me, marketing is about more than just having a customer look at you, it is about finding them and engaging with them on a personal level inside their comfort zone. \nThose that know me will tell you I am a fun loving and easygoing guy, but I have a tenacious desire for success!

Wasted Work: Engineering teams spend too much time talking to people who can't do the job. For every 10 people they interview, 7 are not even qualified enough. Three critical pain points we address: 1. Resume Overload: Drowning in reviewing, sourcing, and screening thousands of resumes filled with technical jargon, making it challenging to identify truly qualified candidates. 2. Candidate Quality: Constantly dealing with dishonest candidates who misrepresent their skills on resumes and in pre-screening calls, leading to unqualified candidates slipping through the process. 3. Resource Drain: Software devs in your company spend an average of 25 hours per hire on technical interviews, taking valuable time away from product development and causing project delays. As ex-software developers, we know exactly what a developer is expected to do (and demand). So we always make sure to bring you the best-possible candidates. Interested in working together? You can book a short, 15-minute call with me where we'll: 1. Identify your current hiring struggles 2. Identify the unique needs for your team 3. Walk you through the No B.S. Devs process Book here: https://calendly.com/no-bs-devs/client-intro If we're the right fit, we'll send over our best offer to you, so that we can send over the best candidates to you, as well - as soon as possible!

    "recruiter_about": "I'm motivated by helping people change their lives for the better. I have a knack for trusting my intuition and taking leaps of faith as well as being pleasantly persistent. :) \n\nFor Ex: Who else leaves a decade long successful career in Advertising to shift into Recruitment or gets laid off and buys a one way ticket to Sydney, Australia with only a Visa in hand and finds a dream job. It was all scary but with a risk, it yields a award - whether it's a great story or a learning lesson. :)\n\nCurrently, I'm a recruiter hiring Go to Market - Enterprise level Solution Engineers and Solution Architects (Pre and Post Sales) at Twilio. It's been a dream to work with such talent here at Twilio and have such amazing conversations with candidates. \n\nPreviously, I hired online Educators (Teachers, Principles, Nurses etc) you would find at a brick and mortar school for K12.com. It was incredibly rewarding to have the impact knowing that I'm hiring well qualified educators to help shape the future. \n\nI started my recruitment career as Tech Recruiter at Computer Futures where I was for almost two years until Covid came crashing the world to a halt. I learned the ups and downs of contract recruitment and was constantly fueled by knowing I can make a difference in someone's life by finding them their dream job. I learned a lot about the USCIS guidelines and felt passionate about ensuring that the most qualified candidates gets the job regardless of Visa status such as H1B/OPT/CPT. \n\nI started my advertising career in 2007 by working at Universal McCann and Initiative Media in Media Planning for companies such as Sony and Hyundai for 3 years and then realized I was a \"people person\" and switched to Advertising Sales. For 8 years I sold, planned and strategized media campaigns for Fortune 500 companies in Los Angeles, CA, Sydney, Australia and Austin, TX. \n\nIn my last job in advertising, I was a Sr. AM at Ad Action, a mobile ad tech start up, where I managed 15 to 30 campaigns with a strategic and analytical mindset to ensure our customers not only had traffic but quality users. Basically, I was a glorified digital campaign analyst where I made sure to optimize mobile streams of traffic to profitability based off CPA (cost per action). \n\nRecruiting Skill-sets: \n\nRecruiting Tools: Boolean, LinkedIn, LinkedIn Recruiter, Indeed, CareerBuilder, Zip Recruiter, Dice, and repository sites like GitHub. I loved other creative ways such as using Facebook, Meet Up events, or even Blind to find candidates. \nI'm motivated by helping people change their lives for the better. I have a knack for trusting my intuition and taking leaps of faith as well as being pleasantly persistent. :) For Ex: Who else leaves a decade long successful career in Advertising to shift into Recruitment or gets laid off and buys a one way ticket to Sydney, Australia with only a Visa in hand and finds a dream job. It was all scary but with a risk, it yields a award - whether it's a great story or a learning lesson. :) Currently, I'm a recruiter hiring Go to Market - Enterprise level Solution Engineers and Solution Architects (Pre and Post Sales) at Twilio. It's been a dream to work with such talent here at Twilio and have such amazing conversations with candidates. Previously, I hired online Educators (Teachers, Principles, Nurses etc) you would find at a brick and mortar school for K12.com. It was incredibly rewarding to have the impact knowing that I'm hiring well qualified educators to help shape the future. I started my recruitment career as Tech Recruiter at Computer Futures where I was for almost two years until Covid came crashing the world to a halt. I learned the ups and downs of contract recruitment and was constantly fueled by knowing I can make a difference in someone's life by finding them their dream job. I learned a lot about the USCIS guidelines and felt passionate about ensuring that the most qualified candidates gets the job regardless of Visa status such as H1B/OPT/CPT. I started my advertising career in 2007 by working at Universal McCann and Initiative Media in Media Planning for companies such as Sony and Hyundai for 3 years and then realized I was a \"people person\" and switched to Advertising Sales. For 8 years I sold, planned and strategized media campaigns for Fortune 500 companies in Los Angeles, CA, Sydney, Australia and Austin, TX. In my last job in advertising, I was a Sr. AM at Ad Action, a mobile ad tech start up, where I managed 15 to 30 campaigns with a strategic and analytical mindset to ensure our customers not only had traffic but quality users.
