The joy and pride I felt as I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from LSU are still fresh in my mind.I couldn't have made it here without my friends and family's unfaltering support and encouragement. Their belief in me kept me motivated and focused even during the most challenging times. They cheered me on every step of the way and celebrated every small victory with me.To my friends who stayed up late with me through thick and thin, helped me understand difficult concepts, and were there to share in the laughter and tough moments - thank you.To my family, your unwavering support and love have been my stronghold. You understood when I had to miss family events due to late-night study sessions and exams, and you were always there with words of encouragement when I needed them most.This degree is not just my achievement but ours. As I close this chapter and look forward to the next, I am filled with anticipation and excitement for the future. But for now, here are some moments from our celebration! (Photos to follow)Reflecting on this journey, I am reminded of an old African proverb, \"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\" This journey was not just about going fast but about going far, and I'm grateful I didn't have to do it alone.With all sincerity from the bottom of my heart, thank you. 💚⚪💚Special shoutout to some key supporters who were there for me through it all:John and Florence Ejim (Parents)Cejay ZhuZheng-Tu ZhengCory WinfreyAnd those I met along the way:Mackenzie McCartyMorgan ShalomDestiny Armstrong, P.E.hashtag#graduation hashtag#LSU2023 hashtag#ComputerScience hashtag#family hashtag#friends hashtag#thankyou",

    "recruiter_experience": "Okay, ignore the fact that I'm holding the trophy backwards for a sec.I'm simply in awe of last night.  To once again represent Gold Turtle Games and be named a finalist for the Developer of the Year award alone was a breathtaking surprise, and I was thrilled to be among so many talented and inspiring black professionals in the technology sector.  I heard stories of professionals that didn't just stop at leading successful businesses and initiatives in their respective fields, but they each went above and beyond material success by making an impact that changed the lives of others in innovative ways.  Being able to have conversations with people like Jyl Feliciano , MBA (She/Her), Shana Feggins, MBA, MPS, SHRM-CP, Nyamekye (Yah-MEH-chay) Wilson, Elizabeth O., Chimu Shikopa, Jaye Watts, ★ Derek Peterson ★, and many more gave me much needed inspiration, guidance, and confidence to push forward with my own endeavors in my career; if I left the event with that alone, I would have been more than satisfied.That said, actually receiving the award was a surprise beyond what I was anticipating, and my family at Table 5 (you know who you are) can attest to how strong the glue on my seat was when my name was called.  I was genuinely at a loss for words at the reveal, and I'm still very much stunned, but after having some time to gather myself since the night, I can determinedly say that I do not take this award nor the experience surrounding it for granted.  Receiving this award among a panel of equally if not more deserving finalists (and I say this meaningfully as I've spoken with all of you) is a privilege and a responsibility that I want to take to the future with drive, intentionality, and boldness. As many said during the night (which I was pleased to hear), ALL glory goes to God.  Becoming who I am today could not be possible Him ordering my steps, leading me, and changing me to His likeness.Shout out to Trent Cobb, Full Sail University, and Gold Turtle Games for empowering me in my journey as a rising game developer!Of course, I have to thank my blood family for being my first and largest support network.  I'm grateful to my momma and papa for instilling values in me that allowed me to persist in this world, and my siblings Melvin Summerville and Juanita Summerville, MSc, PRINCE2®, PMP®, AgilePM®for being role models in my life even from an early age.My family in Christ all over the world - NYC, Arkansas, Georgia, Texas, London, and beyond: your prayers, accountability, and otherwise input in my life have been incredible, and I'm thankful to have support that transcends simply career success and touches the essence of life and purpose itself.Last, but DEFINITELY not least, a HUGE thanks to Black Tech Achievement Awards and all of the amazing participants for making this incredible event possible!!!  Here's to bigger things next year!!!!!!hashtag#allglorytogod hashtag#bta2024 hashtag#btaawards hashtag#GoldTurtleGames hashtag#weAreOutHere",
